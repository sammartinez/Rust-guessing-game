# Guessing Game in Rust

## Overview
I wanted to start off 2021 with a new focus around learning. In my own learning, I haven't gotten to explore as much low-level coding as I once hoped earlier on in my career. The reason being is my career within the Software Industry has been heavily focused around front-end. This guessing game focuses around the Rust handbook, [Chapter 2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) to be exact, with building a guessing game. I may modify this, I may not. But it's here to show I am learning. 

### How to play the game
The game is straight forward, a prompt will ask you to guess a number between 1 and 100. Your goal is guess the exact number to win. There are a few steps needed for the game to work. Here are the steps you need to take:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Once cloned, run `cargo build` to validate no errors with the game.
3. After running `cargo build` has completed, run `cargo run` to start the game.
4. Enjoy
